####A service that creates your resume based on your GitHub repos.

Possible Usecases:

 * Boon for all the tech-savy bosses who want to have a **quick view** of person's git/github activity, _before the interview_

### Opt-In

Thanks to @augustl and other contributors, folks are now able to opt-in. I agree the process is still a tad laborious but basically here's how you opt-in.

1. Fork this repo
2. In your forked repository, add your username to the file `js/opt_in_users.js`, save, and push to your repository.
3. Issue a pull request to resume/resume.github.com
4. I'll merge.

The other way, which can take longer due to the fact that I (@davidcoallier) am bound by the current contraints of our time-space continuum is to ask politely (with a please and thanks (thanks is optional)) on Twitter.
